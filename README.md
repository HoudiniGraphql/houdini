# üé© houdini

The disappearing GraphQL client built for the Svelte community.

## ‚ú®&nbsp;&nbsp;Features

-   Composable and colocated data requirements for your components
-   Document caching with declarative updates
-   Sapper/Sveltekit ready
-   Generated types
-   Customizable error handling (coming soon)

At its core, Houdini seeks to enable a high quality developer experience
without compromising runtime bundle size. Like Svelte, Houdini shifts what is
traditionally handled by a bloated runtime into a compile step that allows
for the generation of an incredibly lean GraphQL abstraction for your application.

## ‚ö°&nbsp;&nbsp;Example

A demo can be found in the <a href='./example'>example directory.</a>

## üïπÔ∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;Installation

Houdini is available on npm:

```sh
yarn add houdini houdini-tools
# or
npm install --save houdini houdini-tools
```

## üîß Configuring Your Environment

Setting up a new houdini project can easily be done with the provided command-line tool:

```sh
npx houdini-tools init
```

This will create a few necessary files as well as pull down a json representation of
your API's schema. Up next, add the preprocessor to your sapper/sveltekit setup. Don't
forget to add it to both the client and the server configurations!

```typescript
import { preprocess as houdini } from 'houdini-tools'

// somewhere in your config file
{
    plugins: [
        svelte({
            preprocess: [houdini()],
        }),
    ]
}
```

With that in place, the only thing left is to configure your client and server environments
to use the generated starting point for your network layer:

```typescript
// in both src/client.js and src/server.js

import { setEnvironment } from 'houdini'
import env from './environment'

setEnvironment(env)
```

## üöÄ Fetching Data
 
Grabbing data from your API is done simply with the `query` function:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
    import { query, graphql } from 'houdini'
    import type { AllItems } from '../../generated'

    // load the items
    const data = query<AllItems>(graphql`
        query AllItems {
            items {
                id
                text
            }
        }
    ` )
</script>

{#each $data.items as item (item.id)}
    <div>{item.text}</div>
{/each}

```

### Query variables and page data

At the moment, query variables are declared as a function in the module context of your component.
This function must be named after your query and takes the same `page` and `session` arguments
that are given to the `preload` function as described in the [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/docs#Pages) 
documentation. Here is an example from the [demo](./example):

```svelte
<script context="module" lang="ts">
    export function AllItemsVariables(page) {
        // if there is no filter assigned, dont enforce one in the query
        if (!page.params.filter || page.params.filter === 'all') {
            return {}
        }

        // make sure we recognize the value
        if (!['active', 'completed', 'all'].includes(page.params.filter)) {
            this.error(400, "filter must be one of 'active' or 'completed'")
            return
        }

        return {
            completed: page.params.filter === 'completed',
        }
    }
</script>
```





### What about `preload`?

Don't worry - that's where the preprocessor comes in. One of its responsibilities is moving the actual 
fetch into a `preload`. You can think of the block at the top of this section as equivalent to:

```svelte
<script context="module">
    export async function preload() {
            return {
                _data: await this.fetch({
                    text: `
                        query AllItems {
                            items {
                                id
                                text
                            }
                        }
                    ` 
                }),
            }
	}
</script>

<script>
    export let _data

    const data = readable(_data, ...)
</script>

{#each $data.items as item (item.id)}
    <div>{item.text}</div>
{/each}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes, Constraints, and Conventions:
- Every GraphQL Document must have a name that is unique
- Variable functions must be names
