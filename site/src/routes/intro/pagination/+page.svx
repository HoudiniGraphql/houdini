# Rendering Long Lists

You'll often run into the situation where you want to render a long list of data.
It's also common for that list to be much too long to query or even render on the screen.
In order to address this, most APIs will accept a set of arguments on the field designed to window
the list and leave it up to the client to keep a running total if the situation calls for it.

As GraphQL has matured, these arguments have somewhat standardized and fall roughly
into two categories: cursor-based pagination and offset-based pagination.
Houdini supports both but since our API relies on cursor-based pagination that's what we're going to show here.
If you want to read more about pagination, head over to the [pagination guide](/guides/pagination).

<GraphQLExplained title="Cursor-Based Pagination">

If you are familiar with cursor-based pagination you can safely skip this section.

Cursor-based pagination is an approach popularized in GraphQL by Facebook's client, [Relay](http://relay.dev). Their flavor of cursor-based pagination is known as "Connections" and relies on some additional types to help us traverse the list. For a practical example, take a look at the API for our PokÃ©dex, specifically the `moves` field on the `Species` type which lets us look up the list of moves that a species can learn:

```graphql
type Species {
	moves(first: Int, after: String): SpeciesMoveConnection!
}

type SpeciesMove {
	learned_at: Int!
	method: String!
	move: Move!
}

type SpeciesMoveConnection {
	edges: [SpeciesMoveEdge!]!
	pageInfo: PageInfo!
	totalCount: Int!
}

type SpeciesMoveEdge {
	cursor: String
	node: SpeciesMove
}

type PageInfo {
	endCursor: String
	hasNextPage: Boolean!
	hasPreviousPage: Boolean!
	startCursor: String
}
```

Any time we have a field that would return a list we want to paginate, we instead return a
Connection type that provides some meta data about the list like our current position
(defined by the `cursor`) and whether or not there is more data to query.
To see how this works in practice, let's look at a query that gets the first 10 items in this list:

```graphql
query {
	species(id: 1) {
		moves(first: 10) {
			pageInfo {
				hasNextPage
				endCursor
			}
			edges {
				cursor
				# this is the move object
				node {
					learned_at
					move {
						name
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

The result of this query looks something like:

```json
{
    "species": {
        "moves": {
            "pageInfo": {
                "hasNextPage": true,
                "endCursor": "k"
            },
            "edges": [
                {
                    "cursor": "a",
                    "node": {
                        "learned_at": 1,
                        "move": {
                            "name": "Growl"
                        }
                    }
                },
                ...,
                {
                    "cursor": "k",
                    "node": {
                        "learned_at": 0,
                        "move": {
                            "name": "Substitute"
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

If we want to look up the next 10 items in the list, we just have to take the `endCursor`
value in the `pageInfo` object and send it as the `after` argument for our next query:

```graphql
query {
	species(id: 1) {
		moves(first: 10, after: "k") {
			pageInfo {
				hasNextPage
				endCursor
			}
			edges {
				cursor
				node {
					learned_at
					move {
						name
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

That will give us the next 10 items after the last item we saw from our previous query.
Houdini takes care of most of this interaction automatically so you don't need to worry too much about it.
Just know that if you are writing a query against a field with connection-based pagination, it looks something like this:

```graphql
query {
	species(id: 1) {
		moves {
			edges {
				node {
					learned_at
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Paginated Queries

Interacting with a paginated query is pretty similar to everything we've been doing so far.
Just decorate the paginated field with the `@paginate` directive. Go ahead and change the `+page.gql` file to look like this:

```graphql:title=src/routes/[[id]]/+page.gql
query Info($id: Int! = 1) {
    species(id: $id) {
        name
        flavor_text
        favorite
        evolution_chain {
            ...SpeciesPreview
        }
        ...SpriteInfo

        moves(first: 1) @paginate {
            edges {
                node {
                    ...MoveDisplay
                }
            }
        }
    }

    favorites @list(name:"FavoriteSpecies") {
        ...FavoritePreview
    }
}
```

At the surface, a paginated query store is basically the same thing as a normal query except for a few extra utilities.
They're pretty self-explanatory but just in case there's any confusion: `loadNextPage` is an async function that will load the next
page and append the result of the field tagged with `@paginate` to the existing value in our cache and
there is a `pageInfo` value on the store that contains an object with meta data about the current page.
For a more in-depth summary of what you can do with `@paginate`, you can check out the [Pagination Guide](/guides/pagination).

It's time to add some visuals. Add an import for the `MoveDisplay` component and copy the following block
as the second child in the right panel (between `div#species-evolution-chain` and the `nav`):

```svelte:title=src/routes/[[id]]/+page.svelte
<MoveDisplay move={$Info.data.species.moves.edges[0].node} />
```

Houdini supports a few different approachs for pagination but we won't go too deep just yet. In our situation,
since we want to display 1 move at a time, we need to pass `SinglePage` as the `mode` for `@paginate`:

```graphql:title=src/routes/[[id]]/+page.gql
query Info($id: Int = 1) {

    # ...

    moves(first: 1) @paginate(mode: SinglePage) {
        edges {
            node {
                ...MoveDisplay
            }
        }
    }

    # ...
}

```

```svelte:title=src/routes/[[id]]/+page.svelte&typescriptToggle=true
<script lang="ts">
    import { UpButton, DownButton } from '~/components'
</script>

<!-- Use this instead of the move display we added earlier -->
<div id="move-summary">
    <MoveDisplay move={$Info.data.species.moves.edges[0].node} />
    <div id="move-controls">
        <UpButton
            disabled={!$Info.pageInfo.hasPreviousPage}
            on:click={async () => await Info.loadPreviousPage()}
        />
        <DownButton
            disabled={!$Info.pageInfo.hasNextPage}
            on:click={async () => await Info.loadNextPage()}
        />
    </div>
</div>
```

You can now verify that it all works by opening the network tab and clicking on the up and down arrows. You should only see network requests being sent when loading a move we haven't seen before.
