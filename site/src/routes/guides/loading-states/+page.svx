# Loading States

At some point, your users are going to be waiting for data to load from the server. This could be because they
don't live in a place with state-of-the-art internet service or maybe they just stepped into a tunnel. Regardless,
you are going to want to show them _something_ while your request loads.

This guide will go over all of the tools that Houdini provides to help you build interfaces for your loading states.

## A Concrete Example

Before we get too far, let's look at a concrete example so we can have a goal in mind. For this guide,
we're going to be building a loading screen for the Pok√©dex that we constructed in the [Getting Started](/intro) guide:

<p>
    <LoadingPokedex />
</p>

[Here](https://houdini-intro.pages.dev) is a link to the deployed demo if you want to see a working version.
