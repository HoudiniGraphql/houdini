# Migrating to 0.16.0

[Lots changed](/guides/release-notes#0160) in 0.16.0. This document outlines the steps you will have to
take to upgrade the houdini-related portions of your app. We recommend doing this while you upgrade
your SvelteKit version since you will be checking/modifying the same files.

```bash
npx svelte-migrate routes
```

## 1. Configuration files

### `./houdini.config.js`

`client` and `include` are the only two things that you **need** to add here.

- `client` needs to be set to a relative path from `houdini.config.js` to a file in
  your project that default exports your client. It can point to a typescript file if appropriate.
- `include` replaces `sourceGlob` but it's not required anymore. The default value is `src/**/*.{svelte,graphql,gql,ts,js}`
  so unless you are doing something special, you can probably just delete it. If you _are_ doing something special,
  make sure that you include `.js` in your extensions so that the generated `+page.js` can be picked up if you use
  an automatic loader. Keep in mind there is a new `exclude` value that might be better suited to your situation.

```diff

  export default {
+   client: "./src/lib/client.ts",
    apiUrl: "http://localhost:4000/graphql",
-   sourceGlob: "./src/**/*.{svelte,graphql,gql},
-   schemaPath: './schema.graphql',
-   framework: "kit",
  }
```

There are also new defaults that likely cover your situation. If you are interested in
cleaning up your config some more, click on this Deep Dive:

<DeepDive title="Cleaning up old values">

Here is a summary of the config changes and new defaults so you can clean up your config file:

- `schemaPath` now has a default value of `./schema.graphql`.
- `static` has been removed. If you were setting it to true, you should now set `framework` to `"svelte"`.
- `apiUrl` is not required anymore if you have a local schema (ie a monorepo or projects like KitQL where everything is being handled by SvelteKit). This will cause the vite plugin to not poll for
- `framework` defaults to `"kit"`
- `module` defaults to `"esm"`
- `routesDir` has been removed. There is now a `projectDir` value that should be used to handle monorepo-like scenarios

</DeepDive>

### `./vite.config.js`

```diff
  import sveltekit from '@sveltejs/kit/vite'
+ import houdini from 'houdini/vite'

  export default {
+   plugins: [ houdini(), sveltekit()],

-   server: {
-     fs: {
-         allow: ['.']
-     }
-   }
  }
```

Update your vite config file to pass Houdini's new plugin before the sveltekit one. With this set up, you'll never have to run `generate` again!
Also, while you're here, you can delete that ugly `server.fs.allow` config you had before.

### `./svelte.config.js`

```diff
  import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-auto'
- import houdini from 'houdini/preprocess'
  import path from 'path'
  import preprocess from 'svelte-preprocess'

  /** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
  const config = {
-  	preprocess: [preprocess(), houdini()],
+  	preprocess: [preprocess()],

  	kit: {
  		adapter: adapter(),

  		alias: {
  			$houdini: path.resolve('./$houdini'),
  			$lib: path.resolve('./src/lib'),
  		},
  	},
  }

  export default config
```

Remove the old preprocessor but leave the alias config.

## 2. Inline Documents

`subscription` and `mutation` are the same for the most part but `query` and `fragment` both
have changes to their API that will require some manual manipulation.

### 2.a Inline Queries

A majority of the work will be done by the SvelteKit migration tool. Anything that used
to be defined in `context="module"` needs to be in `+page.js` (or the typescript equivalent).
This includes variable functions, hooks, etc. You can use the generated `@migration`
comments to track which queries need updating.

Apart from that, the way you access your query data has changed.

```diff
  <script>
-   const { data } = query(graphql`
+   const UserInfo = query(graphql`
      query UserInfo {
        viewer {
          firstName
        }
      }
    `)
  </script>

  <div>
-    {$data.viewer.firstName}
+    {$UserInfo.data.viewer.firstName}
  </div>
```

You can no longer destructure data when using `query`. Instead, `query` returns a store
that holds an object with the data. Methods like `fetch` and `loadNextPage` are attached to
the store itself and do not need the `$`:

```diff
- <button on:click={loadNextPage}>
+ <button on:click={MyStore.loadNextPage}>
    load next
  </button>
```

### 2.b Inline Fragments

The order for the arguments to inline fragments has been inverted.

```diff
  <script>
-   const avatarInfo = fragment(graphql`
+   const avatarInfo = fragment(user, graphql`
        viewer {
          firstName
        }
      }
-     `,
-     user
-   )
+   `)
  </script>

  <div>
     {$avatarInfo.firstName}
  </div>
```

## 3. External Queries

There are 2 different parts to change for every route that used an external document: `+page.svelte` and `+page.js`

### 3.a Page components (`+page.svelte`)

Instead of importing the stores, your components now get them from a
prop passed to your routes. Typescript users can use the standard `PageData` provided by SvelteKit to get type
information for the store. This not only simplifies the mental model but also means we can remove a lot of boilerplate:

```diff
  <script>
-   import { browser } from ' $app/env'
-   import { GQL_MyUserInfo } from '$houdini'
+   export let data

+   $: ({ MyUserInfo } = data)
-   $: browser && GQL_MyUserInfo.fetch()
  </script>

+ {$MyUserInfo.data.viewer.id}
- {$GQL_MyUserInfo.data.viewer.id}
```

### 3.b Page loaders (`+page.js` or `+page.ts`)

The second thing you need to update is the load function. The official migration script will
have already moved everything into the `+page.js/ts` files but you now need to modify the load function
to return a prop that points to your store. To streamline this, Houdini provides a new family
of utility functions:

```diff
- import { GQL_UserInfo } from "$houdini"
+ import { load_UserInfo } from "$houdini"

  export async function load(event) {
-   GQL_UserInfo.fetch({event, variables: { ... }})
-   return {}
+   return {
+     ...await load_MyUserInfo({event, variables: { ... }})
+   }
  }

```

By the way, what we used to call "external documents" we now refer to as "manual loading"
since Houdini can now generate automatic loaders for your external files. Interested?
Check out the new [Working with GraphQL](/guides/working-with-graphql) guide.

## 4. External Mutations

The `mutate` method of mutation stores now reflects the inline equivalent. The first
argument is the variables for the mutation and any additional config comes after:

```diff
  <script>
    import { GQL_MyUpdate } from '$houdini'
  </script>

- <button on:click={() => GQL_MyUpdate.mutate({variables: { ... }})}>
+ <button on:click={() => GQL_MyUpdate.mutate({ ... })}>
    submit
  </button>

```

## 5. TypeScript Config

Houdini now provides type definitions for all of your load functions (variables, hooks, etc).
To set this up, you have to add `$houdini/types` as a `rootDir` in your typescript config file:

```json
{
	// ...
	"compilerOptions": {
		// ...
		"rootDirs": [".", "./.svelte-kit/types", "./$houdini/types"]
	}
}
```

## That's it!

Good luck with your migration! We appreciate your patience as Houdini adapts to SvelteKit's changes. Hopefully you agree
that this new world is a major improvement from where we were a month ago. At the very least, the variables API for
automatic loaders doesn't feel so awkward any more 😅
