# React Framework

This page is currently the best place to go for documentation on Houdini's React framework. While most of the
[guides](/guides) apply to both React and SvelteKit, the API section is very much gear towards SvelteKit users.
Eventually this content will be merged in with the rest of this site but that will take time. Until then, use
this document as the initial place in your search before looking at other options. Also keep in mind this document
is not organized as an introduction but more of a reference. Don't worry - there will be a more guided introduction soon.

<Warning>

Houdini's React binding are still considered unstable and are subject to change with every patch update (the third number).
If you are building stuff with it, please check the changelog for any updates or pin to a specific version.

</Warning>

## What is Houdini?

Houdini is a web application framework built from the ground up for GraphQL. It provides everything you need to build
state-of-the-art apps. Not only does that include basic features like routing and SSR'd queries but also
advanced graphql patterns like paginated fragments and even optimizations for your application's bundle.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to start a new project is to run the following command and answer the prompts:

```bash
npm create houdini@latest
```

Once that's completed, navigate into the newly created directory, install the dependencies using your favorite package manager and then run `dev`:

```bash
cd <project name> && npm i && npm run dev
```

## Routing

At the core of a Houdini application is a filesystem-based located at `src/routes`. You will use it to encode your applications
visual skeleton as well as its data requirements. Routes in houdini are directory-based. That is to say:

- `src/routes` is the root route
- `src/routes/shows` corresponds to a route at `/shows`
- `src/routes/show/[id]` defines a route with a paramter, `id`, that matches a pattern such as `/show/1234`

Each route is defined by the presence of any number of magic files (all of which are conventionally prefixed with `+`).

### Page Views

Page views (defined by `+page.jsx`) are components that are unique to just that route and in many ways _define_ a route. For example, to
define a view at the root of your application you just need to define a component at `src/routes/+page.jsx`:

```jsx:title=src/routes/+page.tsx&typescriptToggle=true
export default () => {
    return <div> Hello Houdini! </div>
}
```

### Layout Views

Layout views (defined by `+layout.jsx`) are components that are shared across multiple routes and are designed to _wrap_
a page view. They are defined very similiarly to pages except they accept a `children` prop and "apply" to all child routes
and a sibling page if the appropriate `+page.jsx` is defined.

```jsx:title=src/routes/+layout.tsx&typescriptToggle=true
export default ({ children }) => {
    return (
        <>
            <NavBar />
            {children}
        </>
    )
}
```

### Links

Links between pages are defined using standard `<a>` tags.

### Route Parameters

Dynamic portions of a route can be labeled using square brackets. For example `src/routes/show/[id]/+page`
creates a page that matches `/shows/1` or `/show/abc`.

<DeepDive title="Rest Paramters">

If the length of a path segment is unknown, you can match multiple segments using the rest syntax. For example:
`src/routes/assets/[...filepath]`.
</DeepDive>

<DeepDive title="Optional Parameters">

Optional parameters are denoted with double brackets, ie `/[[lang]]/home/`.

<Warning>

Optional route parameter cannot follow a rest parameter ([...rest]/[[optional]]),
since parameters are matched 'greedily' and the optional parameter would always be unused.

</Warning>

</DeepDive>

### Route Groups

docs TBD

## Loading data

Just like views are defined in page and layout variants, your applications queries
are defined in `+page.gql` and `+layout.gql` files. Queries must have a unique name:

```graphql:title=src/routes/shows/+page.gql
query ShowList {
    shows {
        title
    }
}
```

Just like their equivalent view component, layout queries are designed to "wrap" child routes and are
accessible by any child (or sibling) page or layout component.

To access the value of a query, your component just needs to accept a prop with the appropriate name.
This could be one query or as many as you have defined. Keep in mind that since this works off of very
simple static analysis, your component props must be spread out from the
argument like so:

```jsx:title=src/routes/shows/+page.tsx&typescriptToggle=true
export default function ({ ShowList }) {
    return (
        <>
            {ShowList.shows.map(show => (
                <div>
                    {show.title}
                </div>
            ))}
        </>
    )
}
```

An arrow function would have also worked as long as it had `{ ShowList }` or `{ ShowList, AnotherQuery }`

### Query Variables

If your query contains variables with the same name as a [route parameter](#route-parameters), Houdini will wire the two up.

For example, all you need to do is define this query at `src/routes/show/[id]/+page.gql` and you can visit `/show/123` or `/show/abc`:

```graphql:title=src/routes/show/[id]/+page.gql
query ShowInfo($id: ID!) {
    show(id: $id) {
        name
    }
}
```

### Imperative Handles

Sometimes you need to perform some imperative task on a query (refetching, loading the next page, etc). For these
situations, you should use the `$handle` variant on the query prop. For example:

```jsx:title=src/routes/shows/+page.tsx&typescriptToggle=true
export default function ({ ShowList$handle }) {
    return (
        <>
            <button onClick={ShowList$handle.loadNextPage}>
                Load Next
            </button>
            {ShowList.shows.map(show => (
                <div>
                    {show.title}
                </div>
            ))}
        </>
    )
}
```

### Loading States

Loading states are one of Houdini's most powerful features. Apart from one important difference, all of the information in the
[guide on loading states](/guides/loading-states) applies to the react framework. Hopefully you didn't just click that link because
it's important to remember that you have to use `isPending` from the `$houdini` package when identifying a pending value. What you
see in that guide (checking if `=== PendingValue`) won't work with React 18.2.

Another thing to keep in mind is that for the React framework, the presence of `@loading` implies the existence of a suspense boundary
in your component hierarchy. I know that last sentence might not be totally clear but explaining it more thoroughly will take time so
please be patient.

## Mutations

Mutations are defined by simply wrapping the result of `graphql` in `useMutation`:

```tsx:title=src/routes/shows/[id]/edit/+page.jsx
import { graphql, useMutation } from "$houdini";

export default function EditShow({ AllShows }) {
  const [one, setOne] = React.useState("");
  const [two, setTwo] = React.useState("");

  const mutate = useMutation(graphql(`
      mutation OneTwo($one: String!, $two: String!) {
        do(one: $one, two: $two)
      }
  `))

  return (
    <form onSubmit={() => mutate({one, two})}>
      <input value={one} onChange={(e) => setOne(e.target.value)} />
      <input value={two} onChange={(e) => setTwo(e.target.value)} />
      <button type=â€œsubmit">submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

## Fragments

Fragments are defined inside of the `useFragment` hook:

```tsx:title=src/components/ShowCard.tsx
import { graphql, useMutation } from "$houdini";

export  function ShowCard(props: { show: ShowCardInfo }) {
  const data = useFragment(props.show, graphql(`
    fragment ShowCardInfo on Show {
        name
    }
  `))

  return (
    <div>
        {data.name}
    </div>
  )
}
```

And then can be passed to your graphql query:

```graphql:title=src/routes/show/[id]/+page.gql
query ShowInfo($id: ID!) {
    show(id: $id) {
        ...ShowCardInfo
    }
}
```

And then threaded through to the component:

```tsx:title=src/routes/show/[id]/+page.tsx
export default function ShowInfoView({ ShowInfo }) {
    return (
        <ShowCard show={ShowInfo.show} />
    )
}
```

## Deployment

Deployment of your application is handled by an "adapter" - a simple function that
prepares your project for deployment. Adapters are passed to your application through
the vite plugin:

```javascript:title=vite.config.js
import { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite'
import houdini from 'houdini/vite'
import adapter from 'houdini-adapter-cloudflare'

/** @type {import('vite').UserConfig} */
const config = {
    plugins: [houdini( { adapter } ), ... ]
}

export default config
```

Here is a list of the available adapters:
