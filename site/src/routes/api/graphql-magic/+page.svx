# GraphQL Magic

Houdini adds a number of runtime definitions to your GraphQL schema in order to support its declarative API.

## Fragments

### List Operations

A field marked with `@list` or by passing a name to `@paginate` can use the following fragments in mutations or subscriptions to update the list:

- `[ListName]_insert`: insert the reference into the list
- `[ListName]_remove`: remove the reference from the list
- `[ListName]_toggle`: if the reference is already in the list, remove it; otherwise, add it to the list

Some things worth mentioning:

- Insert locations for for the `insert` and `toggle` fragments can be specified using the `prepend` or `append` directives specified below
- Conditions for the operations can be specified with `@when` or `@when_not` shown below.
- These fragments can be applied to lists and single values.
- Sometimes the runtime needs a little help to hunt down the list you want to mutate. For more information on how to use `@parentID` to help, [see below](#parentidvalue-string).

For more information on using these fragments, head over to the [mutation docs](/api/mutation#lists).

## Directives

### `@list(name: String!)`

`@list` marks a field as the target for list operations. Must be passed a name which defines the fragments that can be used to mutate the list. See the [list operations](#list-operations) for more information.

### `@prepend`

`@prepend` is used in conjunction with the [list operation fragments](#list-operations) to tell the runtime to add the element at the start of the list. Can be used with both `_insert` and `_toggle` fragments. If the list is a member of a fragment, don't forget to specify `@parentID` directive.

### `@append`

`@append` is used in conjunction with the [list operation fragments](#list-operations) to tell the runtime to add the element at the end of the list. Can be used with both `_insert` and `_toggle` fragments. If the list is a member of a fragment, don't forget to specify `@parentID` directive.

### `@allLists`

`@allLists` is used in conjunction with the [list operation fragments](#list-operations) to tell the runtime to add the element to all lists. Can be used with both `_insert` and `_toggle` fragments. You can't have `parentID` at the same time.

### `@when`

`@when` provides a conditional under which the [list operation](#list-operations) should be executed. It takes arguments that match the arguments of the field tagged with `@list` or `@paginate`. For more information, check out the [mutation docs](/api/mutation#lists).

```graphql
mutation UncompleteItem($id: ID!) {
	uncheckItem(item: $id) {
		item {
			# only remove the item from the list of filtered items
			# if we are only showing the completed ones
			...All_Items_remove @when(completed: true)
		}
	}
}
```

### `@when_not`

`@when` provides a conditional under which the [list operation](#list-operations) should not be executed. It takes arguments that match the arguments of the field tagged with `@list` or `@paginate`. For more information, check out the [mutation docs](/api/mutation#lists)

```graphql
mutation NewItem($input: AddItemInput!) {
	addItem(input: $input) {
		# only add the item to the list if we can see uncompleted items
		...All_Items_insert @when_not(completed: true)
	}
}
```

### `@cache(policy: CachePolicy, partial: Boolean)`

`@cache` is used on a query document to customize the cache behavior. This includes informaton like what [cache policy](/guides/caching-data) should be used by the runtime or if you are okay with partial results from the cache. For a full list of cache policies, check out the [caching guide](/guides/caching-data) and for more information on partial responses, see the [section on partial data](/guides/caching-data#partial-data).

### `@paginate(name: String)`

A field marked with `@paginate` is updated with calls to the page loaders returned by the pagination function. For more information on pagination check out the [guide](/guides/pagination). If you pass a value for the `name` argument, the underlying list can be updated using the [operation fragments](/api/mutation#lists).

### `@blocking`

A query marked with `@blocking` will always await the fetch.

### `@blocking_disable`

A query marked with `@blocking_disable` won't block while the fetch resolves when navigating on the client. Keep in mind this will prevent `throwOnError` from capturing the error.

### `@loading(count: Int)`

Used to define the shape of your loading state. For more information, please visit [this guide](/guides/loading-states).

### `@required`

Customizes the behavior of null values at runtime. When a value is null that's marked with `@required`, the parent object is set to `null` instead. For more information, check out [this post](https://relay.dev/blog/2023/01/03/resilient-relay-apps/) on the relay blog.

### `@[TypeName]_delete`

`@[TypeName]_delete` (ie, something like `@User_delete`) is used to delete the user with an id found in the body of a subscription or mutation. Like the operation fragments, this directive can be applied to lists or singular values. For more information see the [mutation docs](/api/mutation#lists).

```graphql
mutation DeleteItem($input: DeleteItemInput!) {
	deleteItem(input: $input) {
		# this will delete the item with the matching id from the cache
		# and remove it from all lists
		deletedID @Item_delete
	}
}
```

### `@parentID(value: String!)`

`@parentID` is used to identify the parent ID for the field marked with `@list` or `@paginate` when it cannot be inferred. For example, imagine a situation where there are multiple users rendered on a view that shows their top 5 bands. That listing is retrieved with a query containing `@list(name: "Favorite_Bands")`:

```graphql
query MyFriendsBandList {
	viewer {
		friends {
			favoriteBands @list(name: "Favorite_Bands") {
				name
			}
		}
	}
}
```

If you want to add a band to the list of a specific user, you need to pass the `id` field of the user found in the `friend` list:

```graphql
mutation FavoriteBand($input: FavoriteBandInput!, $userID: String!) {
	setFavorite(input: $input) {
		# only add the item to the list if we can see uncompleted items
		...Favorite_Bands_insert @parentID(value: $userID)
	}
}
```

## Enums

Houdini generates runtime representations of every enum in your schema. When passing enum values as inputs to your requests
you can use a raw string value or use a utility object if you prefer:

```javascript
import { MyEnum } from '$houdini'

const update = graphql(`
	mutation Update($input: MyEnum!) {
		update(input: $input)
	}
`)

function onClick() {
	// could use a utility object
	update.mutate({ variables: { input: MyEnum.Value1 } })
	// or pass a string directly
	update.mutate({ variables: { input: 'Value1' } })
}
```

### Enum Value Types

Sometimes you want to define the types for function or component and you need to refer to the list of all values for
a particular enum. To do this, import the `$options` variation on your enum:

```typescript
import type { MyEnum$options } from '$houdini'

function (val: MyEnum$options) {

}
```
