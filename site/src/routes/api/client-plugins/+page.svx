# Client Plugins

Client plugins allow you to customize the behavior of your application's documents.
They can be simple things like integrating with a logging service, adding retry logic,
or even entirely new network capabilities like [Live Queries](https://the-guild.dev/blog/subscriptions-and-live-queries-real-time-with-graphql).
