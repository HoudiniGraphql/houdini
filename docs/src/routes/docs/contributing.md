If you are interested in helping out, you can find our [GitHub page](https://github.com/AlecAivazis/houdini) and the [contributing guide](https://github.com/AlecAivazis/houdini/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) should provide some guidance. If you need something more specific, feel free to reach out to @AlecAivazis on the Svelte discord. There's lots to do regardless of how deep you want to dive ðŸ™‚
