# Houdini

The disappearing GraphQL client for Sapper and SvelteKit.

-   Composable and colocated data requirements for your components
-   Normalized cache with declarative updates
-   Generated types
-   Subscriptions
-   Support for SvelteKit and Sapper
-   Pagination (cursors and offsets)

At its core, houdini seeks to enable a high quality developer experience without compromising bundle size. Like Svelte, houdini shifts what is traditionally handled by a bloated runtime into a compile step that allows for the generation of an incredibly lean GraphQL abstraction for your application.
